    * black/dark background
    * bigger/more visible cover pictures
* remove the "Test with sample ISBN" button
* optimize for fast scanning workflow (ie for scanning an entire bookshelf full of books in). Some ideas:
    * less button presses once the scanning process is started. Once one barcode is scanned/recognized, immediately open up the camera/scanner again for the next one. There should be some view of which books have been scanned so far.
    * better barcode recognition. The current implementation works but it takes a kinda long time to recognize the barcode. Please explore ways to optimize this. See if there
